 # Autonomous Vehicle Lane Recognition using CARLA Simulator-
 
This study explores lane recognition in autonomous vehicle navigation using traditional computer vision techniques within the CARLA simulator. Our system leverages Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection, and the Hough transform to reliably detect and track lane markings across various driving scenarios.

**Methodology**

- Gaussian Blur: Initially applied to reduce noise in the images.
- Canny Edge Detection: Used to highlight the edges of the lanes.
- Hough Transform: Identifies and maps straight lines to corresponding lanes, adapting to different lighting and road conditions.

  **Output**
